<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >A natural goal in topology is to try to understand manifolds. Here, unless speci&#xFB01;ed, a
manifold will be connected, compact, oriented, smooth, and boundaryless. In very low
dimensions it is easy to see all the manifolds: In dimension \(1\) the only example is the circle,
and in dimension \(2\) we have the genus \(n\) surfaces. In dimension \(3\), one cannot see all the
examples as easily. Nevertheless, there are methods to represent a \(3\)-manifold that can allow
one to see them. Moreover it isn&#x2019;t too hard to show that all \(3\)-manifolds can be
represented in these ways. Two of these ways are via Heegaard diagrams and Kirby
diagrams.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  The &#xFB01;rst few examples of a 3-manifolds one might come up with are products of spheres:
\(S^3, S^2\times S^1\), and \(S^1\times S^1\times S^1\). How can we try to see these? Well \(S^3\) is probably the most easy to see: we
can view it as the one point compacti&#xFB01;cation of \(\RR ^3\). The other two are naturally
imagined as quotients of objects inside \(\RR ^3\). For example, we might imagine \(S^2\times S^1\) as
a thickened version of the standard \(S^2 \subset \RR ^3\), i.e. a copy of \(S^2 \times [0,1]\), with the inner and outer
layers identi&#xFB01;ed, and we might imagine \(S^1 \times S^1 \times S^1\) as a cube with opposite boundaries
identi&#xFB01;ed.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  However, if we are to come up with a general way of seeing 3-manifolds, we
should try to &#xFB01;nd a uniform way of doing things. One way to try to do this
is to try to decompose a \(3\)-manifold into simpler things. For example, for our
model of \(S^2\times S^1\) as a quotient of \(S^2 \times [0,1] \subset \RR ^3\), we can cut our model down the middle in \(\RR ^3\) as in

isotopy class of the gluing map of its torus boundary which is an oriented di&#xFB00;eomorphism
of the torus. In fact, we only care about the isotopy class of the di&#xFB00;eomorphism of the
torus. Note that if you view the solid torus as a ball with a handle attached, by removing a
small thickened disk with boundary the meridian circle of the handle, you are left with a
ball.

we &#xFB01;rst attach the meridian circle of the handle, we can then attach the thickened disk,
and then we only have a ball left to attach, and there is one way to do this. Thus the only
relevant data is the way in which the meridian circle of one solid torus is attached to the
other. In this case, from our visualization of \(S^2\times S^1\) it is easy to see that the meridian circle is
sent to the same circle with the opposite direction. Thus we can draw a diagram in
which we have &#xFB02;attened out the torus, drawn the meridian circle \(\beta _1\) and its image,
\(\alpha _1\):

\(S^2\times S^1\).

which are \(D^3\)s with \(n\) handles attached, we can represent that \(3\)-manifold with such a diagram.
Such a decomposition is called a <span

a Heegaard diagram.
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >  For \(S^3\) we can get a genus \(0\) Heegaard splitting by taking any ball and its complement. Its
Heegaard diagram consists of just a &#xFB02;attened out sphere. Note that since the
Heegaard diagram determined the manifold and there is only one genus \(0\) Heegaard
diagram, there is only one \(3\)-manifold with a genus \(0\) Heegaard splitting. A more
interesting example is taking the standard torus inside \(S^3\), and looking at it and its
complement. In fact we can construct the new Heegaard splitting from the old one by
taking our ball and adding an unknotted handle to it. This process is called
<span 
class="cmbx-12">stabilization</span>. If we keep doing this to our original Heegaard splitting of \(S^3\), we will get a
series of Heegaard splittings corresponding to the standard genus \(n\) handlebody
in \(S^3\). An example of stabilization and the corresponding Heegaard diagrams are
shown.

<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >  In fact in general we can produce Heegaard splittings, all of which are stably equivalent.
There is a way to do this either within the category of smooth \(3\)-manifolds via Morse
theory, or in the PL category via a deep theorem says that in dimensions \(\leq 4\), PL manifolds
are the same as smooth manifolds. We will stick to thinking about triangulations here, but
one can note that working with triangulations of a smooth manifold is essentially a special
case of Morse theory: indeed, given a triangulation, one can construct a Morse function
whose index \(k\) critical points occur in the center of the \(k\)-simplicies. Then facts and
constructions with our triangulation can correspond to facts about this Morse function we
have constructed.

Note that the image of \(\gamma \) determines the manifold, because after a neighborhood of \(\gamma \)
and the disk it bounds is attached, there is only a sphere left to attach, and
there is a unique way to do this. The attaching map is an orientation reversing
di&#xFB00;eomorphism of the torus, and on homology it acts as an element of \(\begin{bmatrix}-1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 1\end{bmatrix}\SL _2(\ZZ )\). Since we
only care about the image of \(\gamma \) only the \(p,q\) of \(\begin{bmatrix} -q &amp;&amp; a\\ p &amp;&amp; b\end{bmatrix}\) matter, which tells us the image
of \(\gamma \), is the important data. We will call the resulting space the <span 
class="cmbx-12">lens space</span> \(L(p,q)\).
When \(p = 0\), we just get \(S^2\times S^1\), and when \(q = 0\), we get \(S^3\). For \(p \neq 0, q \neq 0\), there is another description of the
lens spaces for \(p\geq 1\) as follows: we will view \(S^3\) as the unit sphere inside \(\CC ^2\), and we can
consider the \(\ZZ /p\ZZ \) action given by multiplication by \((\zeta _p,\zeta _p^q)\), where \(\zeta _p\) is a primitive \(p^{th}\) root of
unity.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >  This action is free, and the lens space is in fact the quotient. To see this, we can &#xFB01;rst
consider an action of \(S^1\subset \CC ^\times \) on \(L(p,q)\) given by multiplication by \((x^{1/p},x^{q/p})\). This action is free on all \((w,z) \in L(p,q)\) except the
circle where \(w = 0\), where the action wraps around the orbit \(q\) times. If \(z = 0\), there is one orbit, and if
\(w \neq 0, z \neq 0\), there is a unique representative of each orbit of the form \((w,z), w \in (0,1), z \in S^1\), so we see that the quotient
space is a cylinder with both ends capped o&#xFB00; with the points \(w = 0\) and \(z = 0\). In other words the
lens space is an \(S^1\) bundle over a sphere that is locally trivial except maybe at
\(w = 0,z = 0\).
</p><!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >  Indeed it is not locally trivial over \(w = 0\), but nevertheless, it is in a nice form near that point.
Namely, we can say that given a rational number \(\frac{q}{p}\), we can form an \(S^1\) bundle called the
<span 
class="cmbx-12">standard &#xFB01;bred torus</span>. This is given by considering \(D^2\times \RR \) where we identify \((a\zeta _p^q,b)=(a,b+1)\). There is a
natural action of \(\RR \) that descends to an action of \(S^1\), yielding a bundle that is trivial except
maybe at \(0 \times \RR \), the exceptional &#xFB01;bre. Rational numbers di&#xFB00;ering by an integer give the
same &#xFB01;bre bundle, and only \(0\) gives the trivial bundle &#x0028;or even a locally trivial
bundle&#x0029;. We can see that the part of the lens space with \(|w|^2 \leq \frac 1 2\), \(|z|^2 \leq \frac 1 2\) are each standard
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
&#xFB01;bred tori. Indeed, let \(kq+rp=1\), so that at \(|w| \leq \frac 1 2\), we have a map of \(S^1\) actions from the \(\frac r q\) &#xFB01;bred
torus given by \((a,b) \mapsto (a\zeta _{pq}^b, \zeta _p^b\sqrt{1- |a|^2})\). This is a surjective map, so it shows that the lens space \(L(p,q)\) can be
obtained by taking the standard &#xFB01;bred \(\frac r q\) solid torus, and identifying &#xFB01;bres on the
boundary.
</p><!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >  With a little more work it also gives a Heegaard decomposition. We can consider an
embedding of \(\frac 1{\sqrt{2}}D^2\times S^1\) &#x0028;here \(S^1\) is \([0,1]/{0=1}\)&#x0029; given by \((a,b) \mapsto (\zeta _p^b\sqrt{1-|a|^2},\zeta _{p}^{bq}a)\). The boundary of this torus is attached to the
boundary of a thinner version of the standard &#xFB01;bred torus, giving a genus \(1\) Heegaard
splitting. To see the attaching map, we only need to look at the image of \(\frac 1{\sqrt{2}}S^1\times 0\). This is the
circle given by \(w= \frac 1{\sqrt{2}}\), whose preimage under the map from the &#xFB01;bred torus consists of \((a,b) \in \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}S^1\times \RR \) with \(a = \frac 1{\sqrt{2}} e^{-2\pi i \frac b{pq}}\).
We can see that it wraps around the meridian \(-k\) times and around the longitude \(p\) times,
since a full loop happens when \(b\) goes from \(0\) to \(k\), in which case we have \((\frac 1{\sqrt{2}}\zeta _q^{-1},p) = (\frac 1{\sqrt{2}}\zeta _q^{rp-1},0) = \zeta _q^{-kq}\). This is the gluing
map for \(L(p,k)\). Note that if we reverse the roles of the solid tori, the matrix representing the
gluing map is inverted, so this is also \(L(p,q)\). By looking at the fundamental group, \(p\) is an
invariant of \(L(p,q)\). \(q\) is not, as we have seen, we can replace \(q\) by \(q+kp\) or its inverse mod
\(p\).
</p><!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >  We have seen that the lens spaces have many decompositions as \(S^1\) bundles that are

spaces.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >  The bundle map is of a Seifert &#xFB01;bre space is sometimes in itself of interest. For example
when \(p=q=1\), this is just the Hopf &#xFB01;bration: the generator of \(\pi _3(S^2)\), and this &#xFB01;bration factors through \(\RR \PP ^3\),
giving the Seifert &#xFB01;bration for \(p=2,q=1\). We can draw a picture of our explicit description of \(\RR \PP ^3\) given
by a quotient of a standard &#xFB01;bred torus. Namely, take a solid torus, and collapse each line
such as the one drawn below to a point. Then each disk turns into a copy of \(\RR \PP ^2\), except
that each copy of \(\RR \PP ^2\) shares a circle in common. By removing one of these \(\RR \PP ^2\), we are
left with an open disk times an open interval, which is the cell decomposition
\(\RR \PP ^3 = \RR ^3\cup \RR \PP ^2\).

there is a canonical longitude, namely the one that is trivial in homology of the
complement of the circle. Then the rational surgery \(\frac p q\) is given by sending the meridian of
the removed solid torus to \(q\) times the longitude plus \(p\) times the meridian. If \(q = 1\),

surgery only changes the attaching map. To see how it changes the attaching map, note
that since \(\frac p q\) surgery speci&#xFB01;es the attaching map from the exterior to the torus, we
need to put in a \(\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}\) to account for the fact that we are changing the attaching

blowing up means on the level of \(3\)-manifolds. The collection of all of these points forms a

becomes smooth, but we are left with a number of these exceptional curves that can tell us
about the singularity. In particular we can recover the \(3\)-manifold associated to the

number of the curve, and two vertices are connected if the corresponding curves

Namely, view \(\SOr (3)\) as the space of unit tangent vectors on \(S^2\), and identify two tangent vectors if
there is a symmetry of the icosahedron taking one tangent vector to the other. We can
easily see the symmetry group of the icosahedron by noting that it acts simply and

of basic questions we can ask about these diagrams. For example, when do two Kirby
diagrams give the same manifold? There are two operations on diagrams, called the <span

meaning that they can be separated from each other, the manifold we get is the same as
the connected sum of the corresponding manifold for each component. The &#xFB01;rst Kirby
move, \(K1\), is given by adding or removing an unlinked \(\pm 1\) framed knot from the diagram, which
by our realization that \(S^3\) is \(L(1,\pm 1)\) amounts to taking a connected sum with \(S^3\), giving the
same manifold. Note however that the \(4\)-manifold that the \(3\)-manifold bounds is

each time \(t\) that is not a critical point or an intersection point, \(F_l\) looks like a collection of
knots \(l^t_1, \dots , l^t_n\), and \(F_k\) looks like a collection of knots \(k^t_1, \dots k^t_m\). At a particular time in the movie \(t\) that is not
a critical point or an intersection point, we can de&#xFB01;ne \(L(t) = \sum _{i,j}L(k^t_i,l^t_j)+i(t)\) where \(i(t)\) is the number of intersection
points at times earlier than \(t\). Clearly \(L\) is constant on intervals where there are no critical

if we prove that \(L\) is constant, then we are done. If we pass through a birth or
death, the introduced or removed unknot was not linked to anything, so \(L\) stays
the same. If we pass through a band, then either one circle splits into two or
two circles combine, but by the method of computing linking numbers in \(S^3\), \(L\) is
again una&#xFB00;ected. Finally, when we pass through an intersection point, the linking
number of the two intersecting components changes by \(1\), as does \(i(t)\), so \(L\) is the same.

we can translate the surface slightly so that it is transverse to itself. Inside the \(2\)-handle, the

perturbed Seifert surfaces of the knot and its longitude with linking number \(n\),

We can also use the intersection form to characterize when the boundary is a

this smooth algebraic surface arose from resolving singularities at that point, that curve is
one of the exceptional curves, and blowing down the \(-1\) vertex in the intersection graph of

spheres which we will call <span 
class="cmbx-12">Seifert homology spheres</span>. Consider the Seifert manifold \(M((a_1,b_1),\dots ,(a_n,b_n))\). We
can ask when this is a homology sphere. To answer this, we can compute its fundmental
group using the Seifert van-Kampen theorem as \(\langle x_1,\dots ,x_n,h|[h,x_i],h^{b_i}x^{a_i},x_1,\dots x_n\rangle \). By abelianizing, we get homology, which
we would like to be trivial. We have \(n+1\) generators and \(n+1\) abelianized relations, so the
homology is trivial i&#xFB00; the matrix below is nondegenerate: \[\begin{bmatrix} a_1 &amp; &amp; \dots &amp; &amp; b_1\\ &amp; a_2 &amp; \dots &amp; &amp; b_2\\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\ &amp; &amp; \dots &amp; a_n &amp; b_n\\ 1 &amp;1 &amp;\dots &amp; 1 &amp; \end{bmatrix}\] By taking the determinant, the
condition is \(\prod _1^n a_i\sum _1^n\frac{b_i}{a_i} = \pm 1\). In particular, the \(a_i\) must be pairwise coprime. In practice, we assume
that the \(a_i\) are positive and at least \(2\). If this is the case, there is a unique Seifert
manifold where the determinant above is \(1\). To see this, note that our choices of \(b_i\) are
unique up to changing to \(b'_i = b_i+k_ia_i\) where \(\sum _i{k_i} = 0\). To see that these give the same manifold, note
that in continued fraction notation, \([0,-k_i,\frac{a_i}{b_i}] = \frac{a_i}{b'_i}\). Thus the two pictures in Figure <a 
href="#x1-202136">36<!--tex4ht:ref: SeifertHomologySphere --></a> are the
same, but then we can contract all the non-central \(0\) unknots to get connected
sums, but since \(\sum _ik_i = 0\), the framing of the unknot in the center stays the same. We
will call the Seifert homology sphere \(\Sigma (a_1,\dots ,a_n)\). Note that \(\Sigma (2,3,5)\) is the Poincar&#x00E9; homology

<!--l. 517--><p class="indent" >  The construction of \(T(p,q)\) is analogous to the construction of \(\Sigma (p,q,r)\), and there is actually a
connection between them. Namely, consider the map from \(\Sigma (p,q,r)\) to \(S^3\) given by sending \((x,y,z) \subset \CC ^3 \mapsto \frac{(x,y)}{|(x,y)|}\).
di&#xFB00;erential of this map is full rank except at \(z = 0\), and the preimage of each point with \(z \neq 0\) is \(r\)
points. There is a \(\ZZ /r\ZZ \) action on the points with \(z \neq 0\) given by \((x,y,z) \mapsto (x,y,z\zeta _r)\). Note also that the image of the
points with \(z= 0\) is exactly \(T(p,q)\). Thus if we remove \(T(p,q)\), this map is a normal cyclic covering map.
There is a unique index \(r\) subgroup of the fundamental group of the complement of \(T(p,q)\) with
cyclic quotient, since the &#xFB01;rst homology of the complement is \(\ZZ \) by Alexander duality. This
is called the \(r\)<span 
class="cmbx-12">-fold cyclic branched cover </span>of \(T(p,q)\). In particular, by letting \(\{p,q,r\} = \{2,3,5\}\) we get three more
descriptions of the Poincar&#x00E9; homology sphere. We can describe the construction of this
branched cover more concretely: take a Seifert surface \(F\) of the knot \(k\), thicken and remove
the interior from \(S^3\), so that we get two surfaces \(F_+,F_-\) corresponding to the positive and
negative orientation directions of \(F\). Note that if we identify \(F_+\) and \(F_-\) we get back \(S^3\).
Do this to \(r\) copies of \(S^3\) labelled \(S^3_i, i \in \ZZ /r\ZZ \), and similarly index the corresponding \(F_+,F_-\) surfaces
in each. Now glue them all together by identifying \(F_{+,i},F_{-,i+1}\). This is the space of the
branched cover, and the covering map is given by identifying each of the \(S^3_i\) with
\(S^3\).

<!--l. 520--><p class="noindent" >We have seen that looking at links and knots inside \(3\)-manifolds can be important in
studying them. Hence we can try to systematically study links, by assigning invariants to
them &#x0028;and seeing how they relate to invariants on the corresponding \(3\)-manifold&#x0029;. From the
previous section on \(3\)-manifolds, we already have some ways of getting information out of a
knot to help distinguish them. For example, \(\Sigma (2,3,7),\Sigma (2,3,5)\), and \(S^3\) all have di&#xFB00;erent fundamental groups,
since we have seen that \(\Sigma (2,3,5)\)&#x2019;s is order \(120\), and it is not too hard to show that \(\Sigma (2,3,7)\)&#x2019;s is in&#xFB01;nite. Thus
the left-handed trefoil, the right-handed trefoil, and the unknot must all be distinct knots,
since surgery yields di&#xFB00;erent \(3\)-manifolds. Such methods are useful for studying
knots, but it would be nice to have more elementary methods. A deep theorem of
Gordon and Luecke &#x005B;<a id="page.110"></a><a 
href="3-Manifolds_Knots_and_Homology_3-Spheres_Junior_Paper.html#X0-gordonluecke" >GL89</a>&#x005D; says that in general, nontrivial Dehn surgery on a
nontrivial knot never gives \(S^3\), and as a corollary they prove that knots in \(S^3\) are
determined by their complement, so one approach to studying knot invariants is to
&#xFB01;nd invariants of the complement. Note that links are not determined by their
complement: consider any link containing an unknot. The complement of the unknot is
a copy of \((D^2)^o \times S^1\), where \((D^2)^o\) is the interior of the unit disk. Then we can &#x201C;twist&#x201D; \(D^2\times S^1\) via a
di&#xFB00;eomorphism such as \((a,b) \mapsto (ab,b)\). If another component of the link is in the component, this
twisting can yield another link with the same complement. Below is shown an
example:

under stabilization in order to see that it gives a well-de&#xFB01;ned invariant, which is true since
stabilization changes the Seifert matrix \(S\) by turning it into \[\begin{bmatrix} &amp; &amp; &amp; * &amp; 0\\ &amp; S &amp; &amp;\vdots &amp;\vdots \\ &amp; &amp; &amp; * &amp;0\\ *&amp; \dots &amp; *&amp; * &amp; 1\\ 0&amp;\dots &amp; 0 &amp; 0&amp; 0\\ \end{bmatrix} \] Thus the Alexander

Alexander polynomial of the left-handed trefoil using the Seifert matrix to be
\((t^{\frac 1 2}-t^{-\frac 1 2})^2+t) = t-1+t^{-1}\) which again distinguishes it from the unknot, for which \(\Delta = 1\). In \(S^3\) the Alexander

need to &#xFB01;rst note that the Alexander polynomial makes sense for links, and our
existence of Seifert surfaces &#x0028;if the surface is not connected, add tubes to connect
the components&#x0029;. Note that if the link can be split into two pieces that have
disjoint Seifert surfaces \(F,G\), the Alexander polynomial of the link is \(0\), as we can
tube \(F\) and \(G\) together adding one more generator of \(H_1\) for the tube, and then the
Seifert matrix of the link will be given by \(S_F\oplus S_G \oplus \begin{bmatrix} 0 \end{bmatrix}\), where \(S_F,S_G\) are the Seifert matrices of

polynomial satis&#xFB01;es the <span

Alexander polynomial is a knot invariant and that the unknot has Alexander
polynomial \(1\) allows one to inductively compute the Alexander polynomial of any link
in \(S^3\) by simplifying the computation to links whose Alexander polynomials are
already computed. Indeed one could take the skein relation as the de&#xFB01;nition of the
Alexander polynomial in \(S^3\), and many other knot invariants are indeed de&#xFB01;ned by
similar skein relations. We can use the skein relation on one of the crossings
at the twist to see that the two links in Figure <a 
href="#x1-300139">39<!--tex4ht:ref: LinkComplement --></a> have the same Alexander
polynomial.
</p><!--l. 628--><p class="indent" >  The Alexander polynomial enjoys some nice properties. It is clear from the de&#xFB01;nition
that \(\Delta _{L}(t^{-1}) = \Delta _L(t)(-1)^{\rank (S)}\), where \(\rank S\) is the rank of the Seifert matrix. For a knot, this is even, so \(\Delta _K(t) = \Delta _K(t^{-1})\). Given an
oriented link \(L\), we say that \(rL\) is the link given by reversing the orientation of the \(3\)-manifold
&#x0028;in \(S^3\) this amounts to taking a mirror image&#x0029;. \(-L\) is the link given by reversing orientation on
all the components of \(L\). The Seifert matrix of \(-L,rL\) is the same or the transpose as that of \(L\) for
any Seifert surface, so \(\Delta _{L} = \Delta _{-L} = \Delta _{rL}\). Either from the Skein relation or from taking the boundary
connected sum of Seifert surfaces, it follows that \(\Delta _{K_1\#K_2} = \Delta _{K_1}\Delta _{K_2}\). Finally, if \(S\) is the Seifert matrix,
it isn&#x2019;t too hard to see that \(I = S^\top -S\) coincides with the intersection form on the &#xFB01;rst
homology of the surface. The intersection form has a symplectic basis and is
nondegenerate by Poincar&#x00E9; duality if the link has one component. If the link has two
components, any boundary component becomes a nontrivial class that is null in
the intersection form. Thus we get that \(\Delta _L(1)\) is \(1\) if \(L\) is a knot, and \(0\) if \(L\) has multiple
components.

href="3-Manifolds_Knots_and_Homology_3-Spheres_Junior_Paper.html#X0-milnorhusemoller" >MH73</a>&#x005D;, and since this
diagonalization corresponds to doing the second Kirby move, we get the following
lemma:

</p>
  </div>
<!--l. 692--><p class="indent" >  Now if we add \(0\)-framed unknots as meridians of each component of a Kirby diagram of a
homology sphere, we can remove each component so the new Kirby diagram represents \(S^3\).
If the old Kirby diagram already diagonalized the intersection form as in the
lemma above, we can diagonalize the rest of the linking matrix by applying the
second Kirby move to the other components of the diagram. Thus we can get
knots \(c_1,\dots c_n\) such that \(S^3 = \Sigma + \sum _1^n \ee _ic_i\), where \(\ee _i = \pm 1\). Now given a knot \(k\) in the homology sphere, there is a
method to compute its Alexander polynomial. First isotope \(k\) and \(c_1\) separately
in the manifold until they become a <span 
class="cmbx-12">boundary link</span>, meaning that they have
disjoint Seifert surfaces \(F_k,F_{c_1}\). Now if they are a boundary link, then when we are
computing the Seifert matrix, the curves on \(F_k\) as well as their push o&#xFB00;s are disjoint
from \(F_{c_1}\), hence their linking number with \(c_1\) is \(0\), so when computing linking numbers
we can always use Seifert surfaces avoiding \(c_1\). Thus doing surgery doesn&#x2019;t a&#xFB00;ect
the Seifert matrix, and \(\Delta _{k\subset \Sigma }\) = \(\Delta _{k\subset \Sigma +c_1}\). If we do this inductively, we will eventually be left
with a knot in a Kirby diagram of \(S^3\). If we slide \(k\) around using the \(K2\) move, by
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
the fact that we can blow down, we will eventually separate \(k\) from the rest of
the diagram, and then we can compute the Alexander polynomial the usual
way.

<!--l. 742--><p class="noindent" >It is somewhat interesting that homology spheres exist: one might have expected there to
only one homology sphere, which is certainly true in dimensions \(1,2\). After understanding
Dehn surgery and how it can give homology spheres, it is not so surprising that nontrivial
homology spheres exist given that there are nontrivial knots. The Poincar&#x00E9;
conjecture, the question of whether any homotopy sphere is \(S^3\) is much harder, and
one could study homology spheres in the hope of understanding questions like
this better. As we have seen before, the fact that a \(3\)-manifold is a homology
sphere is tied to the intersection form of any \(4\)-manifold it bounds. One could
ask whether we could learn more about the homology sphere from the simply
connected \(4\)-manifold it bounds. The Rokhlin invariant is an invariant that arises this
way.

that is important for understanding high-dimensional manifolds. An h-cobordism is a
cobordism between two manifolds such that the inclusion maps of the cobordism are
homotopy equivalences. The h-cobordism theorem for \(n\)-manifolds says that an h-cobordism
of simply connected \(n-1\)-manifolds \(M_1,M_2\) is trivial in the sense that it is just a product \(M_1\times [0,1]\). This allows
one to prove things such as the Poincar&#x00E9; conjecture, by &#xFB01;rst showing that any homotopy
sphere is h-cobordant to a sphere. However, the h-cobordism theorem fails in
dimension \(4\). Wall, using Smale&#x2019;s techniques was able to get the following weaker
result:

\(4\)-manifolds can be quite hard, as to distinguish two \(4\)-manifolds that have the same

become uninteresting when such copies are added. It is useful for studying \(4\)-manifolds, as
one can &#x201C;simplify&#x201D; a \(4\)-manifold by adding in copies of \(S^2\times S^2\). Indeed in the proof of Rokhlin&#x2019;s

class="cmbx-12">characteristic </span>if \(F\cdot x = x \cdot x \pmod 2\) for
any \(x \in H_2\). Given a characteristic surface in a \(4\)-manifold, we can de&#xFB01;ne a quadratic form on \(H_1(F;\ZZ /2\ZZ )\).
This quadratic form has an <span

basis \(a_i,b_i\) of the associated bilinear form via the formula \(\Arf (q) = \sum q(a_i)q(b_i) \pmod 2\). This formula doesn&#x2019;t depend on the
symplectic basis, and determines the quadratic form up to isomorphism. We write the Arf
invariant of the quadratic form associated to the surface \(F\) as \(\Arf (M,F)\). We say that the

both sides of the equation of Rokhlin&#x2019;s theorem are additive with respect to connected

Kirby diagram, the surface mod \(2\) is a union of components of the link. This union of
components is called a <span 
class="cmbx-12">characteristic sublink</span>. By changing the homology class mod \(2\), we
can assume that the characteristic surface is really just a sum of the generators coming
from the link, hence can be identi&#xFB01;ed with the characteristic sublink. The characteristic
sublink of a plumbed \(3\)-manifold whose vertex is given by a tree must have each pair of
components \(a,b\) of the sublink not connected by an edge. Otherwise, we can reverse the
framing of all the components to the \(a\) side of the tree. The sublink will stay
characteristic, as will the signature, but the linking number between the two vertices
will change sign. We can compute how \(F\)&#x2019;s self intersection will change. Namely,
since \(F\) contains \(a\),\(b\), its self intersection contains a \(2ab\) term which has switched signs
while everything else has remained the same. But this contradicts Rokhlin&#x2019;s
theorem, as the left hand side has changed by \(\frac 1 8 4 = \frac 1 2\), so is not an integer. Thus the
characteristic surface is a union of disjoint generators, hence is represented by a
collection of sphere since the knots are unknots. We can add a band to make the
surface connected, so that the class is a sphere. Thus the Arf invariant is \(0\), so we

homology sphere invariant such as the Rokhlin invariant could distinguish it
from \(S^3\). Casson created an integer lift of the Rokhlin invariant called the Casson
invariant, and one of its many applications included showing that the Rokhlin
invariant was incapable of doing this. If one wanted to create an invariant that
was able to do this, a good strategy would be to create an invariant involving
the fundamental group, so that if it is trivial, the homology sphere should have
trivial invariant. A powerful way to study groups is to study representations, so
one could try to count the number of essentially di&#xFB00;erent representations of the
fundamental group in some linear Lie group. To not get two many representations,
our Lie group should be compact, and because abelian representations of the
fundamental group of a homology sphere are trivial as the abelianization of the
fundamental group is trivial by assumption, our Lie group should be semi-simple. The
simplest such Lie group is \(\SU (2)\), so it might seem natural to think about studying
the space of \(\SU (2)\) representations of the fundamental group, which is what Casson
did.
</p><!--l. 864--><p class="indent" >  For the homology sphere \(\Sigma (p,q,r)\), there are &#xFB01;nitely many distinct irreducible representations
&#x0028;we consider two the same if they are conjugate&#x0029;, so we might try to de&#xFB01;ne an invariant by
simply counting representations. However, it is not generally true that representations
are &#xFB01;nite, and generally &#x0028;even for the general \(\Sigma (p,q,r,s)\)&#x0029; one can have large manifolds of
representations. The solution is to reinterpret the space of representations as the
intersection of two half dimensional manifolds of some larger manifold. Then large
numbers of representations could only be due to the intersection not being transverse, so
by perturbing these two half dimensional manifolds we can take their intersection
number.

diagram on the fundamental group, so that \(\sR (\Sigma )\) is exactly the intersection \(\sR (H_1)\cap \sR (H_2)\). \(SU(2)\) is \(3\)-dimensional,
so consequently if \(F\) is genus \(g\), \(\sR (F_0)\) is \(6g-3\) dimensional as \(\pi _1(F_0)\) is free, but we also mod out by
conjugation. \(\sR (F)\) is \(6g-6\) dimensional as there is one relation that removes a degree of freedom. The
representation space of each handlebody is dimension \(3g-3\), since the fundamental group is free
again. Thus the representation space of each handlebody is a half dimensional subspace of
the representation space of the surface, with intersection exactly \(\sR (\Sigma )\). The irreducible
representations of \(\sR (H_i)\) are an open smooth part of the representation space, so if we are
careful to avoid the singularities &#x0028;i.e the trivial representation, we can perturb the
\(\sR (H_i)\) and get an intersection number. One must be a little careful when thinking
about orientations, but one we &#xFB01;x an orientation convention, we have a Casson

normalization.

Given a two component link \(k,l\), the number \[\lambda (\Sigma +\frac 1{m+1}k+\frac 1{n+1}l) - \lambda (\Sigma +\frac 1{m}k+\frac 1{n+1}l) - \lambda (\Sigma +\frac 1{m}k+\frac 1{n+1}l) + \lambda (\Sigma +\frac 1{m}k+\frac 1{n}l)\] is not dependent on \(m\) or \(n\), so that we can call
this number \(\lambda ''(k,l \subset \Sigma )\). The third axiom says that for a boundary link, this number is
\(0\).

sphere \(\Sigma (2,3,6n-1)\). From the &#xFB01;rst and second axioms, we can compute the Casson invariant of these
homology spheres to be \(-n\). Since \(\Sigma (2,3,6n+1)\) is obtained from surgery on the right-handed trefoil, which
has the same Alexander polynomial, we see that \(\lambda (2,3,6n+1) = -n\).
</p><!--l. 901--><p class="indent" >  More generally, one can compute the \(\Delta _{T(p,q)''(1)} = \frac{(p^2-1)(q^2-1)}{12}\), so that by the surgery formula again

href="3-Manifolds_Knots_and_Homology_3-Spheres_Junior_Paper.html#X0-freedman" >Fre82</a>&#x005D;, for any unimodular even
symmetric bilinear form, there is exactly one simply connected, closed topological manifold
with that as its intersection form. The idea of the existence part of his theorem is to show
that every homology \(3\)-sphere bounds a homology \(4\)-ball. Then given an intersection form,
one can &#xFB01;nd a smooth simply connected \(4\)-manifold realizing that intersection form, and
cap it o&#xFB00; with the homology \(4\)-ball. For example, the plumbing diagram for \(\Sigma (2,3,5)\) gives a
smooth \(4\)-manifold with boundary \(\Sigma (2,3,5)\). If we cap it o&#xFB00; with a homology ball, we
get a topological \(4\)-manifold called \(W_8\) with unimodular even intersection from but
signature \(-8\). By Rokhlin&#x2019;s theorem \(W_8\) cannot be smooth. This construction is quite
general, and can produce lots of \(4\)-manifolds which are not smooth. With a little
more work using the Casson invariant, one can even show that they are not
triangulable.
</p><!--l. 909--><p class="indent" >  We have seen that even though there are quite a lot of \(3\)-manifolds, we can still

in \(S^3\), but also more generally in homology spheres. In studying homology spheres,
we were able to look at two related invariants, that of Casson and of Rokhlin,
which we have seen have many applications to our understanding the topology of
\(3\)-manifolds.
