<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >Say we have a variety over some &#xFB01;nite extension of \(\QQ \). How can we tell if it is actually de&#xFB01;ned over \(\QQ \)
and simply extended to the larger &#xFB01;eld? How many isomorphism classes of such varieties over \(\QQ \) are
there? Descent gives us a systematic way to approach this type of problem. Roughly, it is
analogous to the following kind of topological problem:
</p><!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >  Say we have a principal \(G\)-bundle \(\xi \) de&#xFB01;ned over some space \(X\) and a local homeomorphism \(X \to Y\). Then is \(\xi \)
the pullback of a \(G\)-bundle on \(Y\)? How can one classify all the possible \(G\)-bundles on \(Y\) that \(\xi \) is a pullback
of?
</p><!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  Suppose now that \(X\) is actually an open cover of \(Y\), and \(\xi \) is trivial. Then the solution is quite
classical. A \(G\)-bundle on \(X\) is determined by \(G\)-bundles on \(Y\) along with transition functions on the
intersections, and so the &#x010C;ech cohomology of the cover, \(\check{H}^1(X \to Y,G)\), classi&#xFB01;es the \(G\)-bundles on
\(Y\).
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >  Grothendieck realized that one can take the same point of view quite generally in the
algebro-geometric world: view the &#xFB01;nite extension of \(\QQ \) as a cover of \(\QQ \). The idea of being able to glue
on an cover works just as well here, because of the main results presented here: a &#xFB01;nite &#xFB01;eld
extension is an fpqc morphism. Then again the solution to the problem becomes classi&#xFB01;ed by
equivalence classes of ways to glue, which sometimes amounts to a kind of &#x010C;ech cohomology of the
cover.
</p><!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >  In fact, we will see that &#xFB01;nite Galois extensions can be thought of as principal \(G\)-bundles, or
\(G\)-torsors, over the base &#xFB01;eld, where \(G\) is the Galois group thought of as a discrete group. This
helps clarify the relationship between the extension and the base &#xFB01;eld, as there are very
general correspondences between principal bundles and the objects they are de&#xFB01;ned
over.

 id="x1-20002"></a>Glueing morphisms on an fpqc cover</h3>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >If we have an open cover of schemes \(U_i \to U\) and maps \(f_i: U_i \to V\) that the \(f_i\) agree on the intersections \(U_i \cap U_j = U_i \times _U U_j\), we can glue
the \(f_i\) together to form a morphism \(f:U \to V\). Amazingly enough, it is not necessary that the maps \(U_i \to U\) are an
open cover in the Zariski topology. Rather, we can require them to be faithfully &#xFB02;at quasi-compact
&#x0028;or fpqc&#x0029; cover. This means that the map \(\coprod U_i \to U\) is faithfully &#xFB02;at, and has the property that every point
has a quasi-compact neighborhood whose image is a&#xFB03;ne and open. If a faithfully &#xFB02;at
morphism is locally of &#xFB01;nite presentation &#x0028;we call this fppf&#x0029;, it is an open map, and hence
fpqc. Thus &#x00E9;tale and smooth covers locally of &#xFB01;nite presentation are examples of fpqc
covers.

<span 
class="cmti-12">Proof.</span> </span>
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >  First note that we can pretend that the cover \(W_i\) is just one object \(W\) by letting \(W\) be the disjoint
union of the \(W_i\).
</p><!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >  The quasi-compactness condition will let us reduce to the case when \(U,W\) are a&#xFB03;ne. Indeed,
suppose the theorem holds in this case. By the quasi-compactness condition, there is a &#xFB01;nite
quasi-compact open cover \(W_i\) whose images \(U_i\) are an a&#xFB03;ne open cover of \(U\). Let \(W_{ij}\) be an open a&#xFB03;ne
cover of \(W_i\). Then from the case where \(U,W\) are a&#xFB03;ne, we can glue the morphism of \(W\) restricted to
each \(W_{ij}\) to get a morphism on each \(U_i\). By the uniqueness in the a&#xFB03;ne case, we see that if a glued
map \(U \to V\) exists, it must restrict to these maps, and so we get uniqueness of the glued map \(U \to V\) &#x0028;if it
exists&#x0029;. In particular, the glued maps \(U_i \to V\) restricts to a unique glued map on \(U_{ij}\), so can be glued
together to form a map \(U \to V\). It is easy to see this is the morphism we want.
</p><!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >  From now on, \(U,W\) are a&#xFB03;ne. Suppose that the theorem holds when \(V\) is a&#xFB03;ne. Then for general
\(V\), if existence holds, then uniqueness holds, as it holds when restricting to an a&#xFB03;ne cover of
\(V\), and a morphism is determined by what it is on an open cover. For existence, for any two
points \(v,w \in W\) with the same image \(u \in U\), it is easy to see that there is a point in \(W \times _U W\) which projects to \(v,w\) via
the two projections &#x0028;choose a maximal ideal in \(k(v) \otimes _{k(u)} k(w)\)&#x0029;. Thus there is a well-de&#xFB01;ned set theoretic
map \(U \to V\) that glues together the map from \(W\). The map \(W \to U\) is continuous, surjective, and open &#x0028;as
it is &#xFB02;at and quasi-compact&#x0029;, so the topology on \(U\) is the one induced by the morphism from
\(W\). Moreover, we can turn this into a map of ringed spaces by using the unique map that is
there for each a&#xFB03;ne open of \(V\). These glue by uniqueness to give the desired morphism.
</p><!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >  Finally consider the case when \(W,U,V\) are a&#xFB03;ne. Let \(W = \Spec A, U = \Spec B, V = \Spec C\). Then \(A\) is a faithfully &#xFB02;at \(B\)-algebra, and
there is a map \(C \to A\) such that the two maps \(C \to A\otimes _B A\) agree. We would like to show that there is a map
\(C \to B\) that is compatible with the map to \(A\). It su&#xFB03;ces to show that the sequence \(0 \to A \to B \to B \otimes _A B\) is exact, where
the map \(B \to B\otimes _A B\) is the di&#xFB00;erence of the two projections. To see this, since \(B\) is faithfully &#xFB02;at over \(A\),
this sequence is exact i&#xFB00; \(0 \to B \to B \otimes _A B \to (B\otimes _A B)\otimes _A B = (B\otimes _A B) \otimes _{B} (B \otimes _A B)\) is exact. Note that this is an exact sequence of the same form as
before if we let \(D = B \otimes _A B\).
</p><!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >  Clearly \(B \to D\) is injective as \(D\) is faithfully &#xFB02;at over \(B\). \(B \to D \to D \otimes _B D\) clearly composes to \(0\). We only need to show
the kernel of \(D \to D \otimes _B D\) is in \(B\).
</p><!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >  The morphism \(B \to B\otimes _A B\) has a section \(f\) given by the multiplication &#x0028;diagonal&#x0029; map. If \(a\) is in the
kernel of the map \(D \to D \otimes _B D\), then \(a\otimes 1 = 1 \otimes a\), so applying \(f\) to both sides we have \(f(a) = a\), and so \(a \in B\). <span class="qed"><span

also objects over a scheme and morphisms between them, in particular quasi-coherent sheaves.
Suppose one has a presheaf of categories \(F: C^{op} \to Cat\). We can think of \(F\) as sending \(O \in C\) to a category of objects
over \(O\), and a morphism \(f:O \to P\) to a &#x201C;pullback&#x201D; functor \(f^*:F(P) \to F(O)\). We can then form a category of \(F\)-objects over \(C\) as
follows: the objects are pairs \((O,o), o \in F(o)\). The morphisms are pairs \((f,g): (O,o) \to (P,p)\), where \(f:O \to P\) is a morphism and \(g:o \to f^*p\) is a morphism.
We call this the <span 
class="cmbx-12">&#xFB01;bred category </span>associated to the functor \(F\) &#x0028;denoted \(F/C\)&#x0029;, and it comes with a
forgetful functor to \(C\).
</p><!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >  Here I will ignore issues dealing with objects being canonically isomorphic but not identical. If
this is allowed, then we can make a functor \(\Sch ^{op} \to \Cat \) sending a scheme to its category of quasi-coherent

Note in reality if \(f:A \to B, g:B \to C\) are morphisms of schemes, \((g \circ f)^*\)
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
is only canonically isomorphic to \(g^* \circ f^*\), but this will be ignored here. The general notion of a &#xFB01;bred
category exists to deal with this kind of issue, but otherwise doesn&#x2019;t add much substantial. Indeed,
every &#xFB01;bred category is equivalent &#x0028;in the sense of &#xFB01;bred categories&#x0029; to one that comes from an
actual functor.
</p><!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >  The notion of a stack is the right generalization of sheaf to category valued presheaves &#x0028;or &#xFB01;bred
categories&#x0029; on \(C\). It can be thought of as a category of objects over \(C\) that are de&#xFB01;ned
locally in the topology on \(C\). Here is the idea: suppose we have a cover \(U_i \to U\), objects \(\xi _i/U_i \in F/C\) &#x0028;this
means \(F(\xi _i) = U_i\)&#x0029;, and isomorphisms \(\varphi _{ij}: \pi _1^* \xi _i \to \pi _2^* \xi _j\) in \(F(U_i\times _U U_j)\) that satisfy the cocycle condition \(\varphi _{ij} \circ \varphi _{jk} = \varphi _{ik}\) after pulling back to \(U_i\times _U U_j \times _U U_k\).
Then if \(F\) is a stack, then giving this data should be the same as giving an object over
\(U\).
</p><!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >  More precisely, given a cover \(U_i \to U\), and a &#xFB01;bred category \(F\), we can form a category of descent data \(F(U_i \to U)\)

morphisms \((\xi _i, \varphi _{ij}) \to (\xi '_i, \varphi '_{ij})\) are morphisms \(f_i:\xi _i \to \xi '_i\) such that \(F\pi _2^*f_j \circ \varphi _{ij} = \varphi '_{ij} \circ F\pi _1^*f_u\). There is a natural functor \(F(U) \to F(U_i \to U)\) sending an object \(\xi /U\) to the
pullback of \(\xi \) along the cover, where \(\phi _{ij}\) are canonical isomorphisms. Then \(F\) is a <span

cover, the functor \(F(U) \to F(U_i \to U)\) is an equivalence. Basic examples include categories of &#xFB01;bre bundles and
categories of sheaves in the topology that they are de&#xFB01;ned over. What is surprising is that although
quasi-coherent sheaves are de&#xFB01;ned in the Zariski topology, they form a stack in the fpqc topology,
which is much &#xFB01;ner.
</p><!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >  One note: being a stack is only dependant on \(F\) up to equivalence of &#xFB01;bred categories, and is not
dependant on less than the pretopology, but rather the topology it induces. Namely, say that a
collection of morphisms \(V_i \xrightarrow{f_i} U\) is a re&#xFB01;nement of \(U_i \xrightarrow{g_i} U\) if each \(f_i\) factors through some \(g_j\). Then \(F(U) \to F(U_i \to U)\) is actually an
equivalence if it has a re&#xFB01;nement for which it is.

sheaf. Thus by the previous result for sheaves, \(F\) is a prestack. It remains to show that the
functors \(F(U) \to F(U_i \to U)\) are essentially surjective.
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="indent" >  Next, we can reduce to the case when the cover is a single morphism. Indeed, let \(V = \coprod _i U_i\). Then
there is a natural morphism \(F(V \to U) \to F(U_i \to U)\) and to reduce to showing it for \(V\) we need to show this is
essentially surjective. We can consider the Zariski cover \(U_i \to V\), and note we have \(V \times _U V \cong \coprod _{ij} U_i\times _U U_j\), so given descent
data \((\xi _i, \varphi _{ij}) \in F(U_i \to U)\), we can glue \(\xi _i\) to a \(\xi /V\) and similarly the \(\varphi _{ij}\) can be glued to a \(\varphi \) for \(V\) in the Zariski topology.
Then \((\varphi ,\xi ) \in F(V \to U)\) gets sent to something isomorphic to our original descent data.

pullback this data to get \((\xi _i,\varphi _i)\), which glues together to give objects \(\chi _i/U_i\). Note that we can pullback \(\chi _i\)
to \(U_i \cap U_j\), and by the fact that \(F(V_i\cap V_j \to U_i \cap U_j)\) is a prestack, the pullback of \(\chi _i\) will agree with the pullback of \(\chi _j\) up to
the glued pullback of \(\varphi _i\), so since \(F\) is a stack in the Zariski topology, we get our desired glued
object over \(U\).

be re&#xFB01;ned by a morphism of a&#xFB03;ne schemes. To show essential surjectivity for \(F(V \to U)\), it su&#xFB03;ces
to show then that the natural map \(F(V \to U) \to F(V_i \to U)\) is faithful for some \(i\) because of the factorization of the
natural map \(F(U) \to F(V\to U) \to F(V_i \to U)\). But it must be since if two morphisms restrict to the same thing on \(V_i\), they
must restrict to the same thing on \(V_i \cup V_j\) for any \(j\) as \(F(V_i\cup V_j \to U) \to F(V_i \cup U)\) is an equivalence as \(V_i \cup V_j \to U\) is quasi-compact. Thus

to &#xFB01;nd descent data, which is given by an isomorphism from the conic extended via the
&#xFB01;rst and second projections, or in other words, it is an isomorphism \(\phi \) from \(x^2 + 2ixy + z^2 = 0\) to \(x^2 - 2ixy + z^2 = 0\) and an
automorphism \(\varphi \) of \(x^2 + 2ixy + z^2= 0\). The cocycle condition says that \(\varphi \) is the identity, and that \(\phi \circ \bar{\phi } = 1_C\). Now we can
&#xFB01;nd some \(\phi \)s that work. Some examples that work send \((x:y:z)\) to \((-x:y:z)\), \((x:-y:z)\), \((x+2iy:y:z)\), or \((-ix:-iy-z:z)\). Note that these
can give genuinely di&#xFB00;erent \(\QQ \)-varieties. By looking at the change of variables \(w = x+iy\) we have \(w^2+y^2+z^2 = 0\),
which is clearly de&#xFB01;ned over \(\QQ \). Indeed, this change of variables corresponds to the descent
data where \(\phi \) is \((x+2iy:y:z)\), and the variety that is descended to is not isomorphic to \(\PP ^1_\QQ \), as there
are no rational points. On the other hand \(\PP ^1_\QQ \) is clearly one possible variety that can be
obtained.

\(G\)-equivariant objects.
</p><!--l. 170--><p class="indent" >  Unfortunately the example above is not linear, in that it is hard to make a cohomology theory
to classify such extensions. Cohomology is more likely to work for descent on objects
with multiplicative structure. For example, let \(V\) be a &#xFB01;nite dimensional vector space
over a &#xFB01;eld \(k\), and let \(K/k\) be a &#xFB01;nite extension. Viewing \(V\) as a scheme &#x0028;the associated vector
bundle&#x0029;, we can consider the group presheaf on schemes over \(k\), \(G = \Aut (V)\), that takes a \(k\)-scheme \(U\)
to \(\Aut _U(V \otimes U)\), the group of linear automorphisms of that &#xFB01;x the projection to \(U\). This functor is
represented by \(\GL _k(V)\). Now we can consider the problem of classifying other vector spaces \(V'\) that
become the same as \(V\) when extended to \(K\). Clearly \(V\) is the only one since a vector space
is determined up to isomorphism by its dimension, but this now has a cohomological
interpretation. Letting \(S = \Spec K\), descent data is then exactly an element \(\varphi \) of \(G(S\times S)\) satisfying \(G(\pi _2)(\varphi ) = G(\pi _1)(\varphi ) G(\pi _3)(\varphi )\) in \(G(S\times S \times S)\). Moreover
an isomorphism between two descended objects gives an element \(\lambda \in G(S)\) such that on the
descent data \(\phi _1, \phi _2\), we have \(G(\pi _1)(\lambda )\phi _1 G(\pi _2)^{-1} =\phi _2\). With this knowledge we can make a &#x201C;chain complex&#x201D; \[ G(S) \to G(S\times S) \to G(S\times S \times S) \] where
the &#xFB01;rst map is really an action of \(G(S)\) on \(G(S\times S)\) and the second map is \(G(\pi _1)G(\pi _3)G(\pi _2)^{-1}\). The orbits that are
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
in the kernel of the map \(G(S\times S) \to G(S \times S \times S)\) then correspond to the isomorphism classes of objects that
descend to the same thing as \(V\), and this is also the &#xFB01;rst cohomology of the complex above,
denoted \(H^1(S/\Spec k,\GL (V))\). If \(G\) is abelian &#x0028;for example if \(V\) is one dimensional&#x0029;, then the exact sequence
above is a genuine sequence of abelian groups. This more generally is a non-abelian
&#x010C;ech cohomology of the cover \(S/\Spec k\), and by our observations above we have shown \(H^1(S/\Spec k, \GL _k(V)) = 0\). Note
this is a generalization of Hilbert&#x2019;s theorem \(90\), which is the case \(V\) is one-dimensional.
In particular, since &#x00E9;tale covers of \(k\) are essentially &#xFB01;nite extensions and since &#x010C;ech
cohomology in the limit over all covers should be the &#x00E9;tale cohomology, this shows that
\(H^1(\Spec k, \GL _k(V)) = 0\).
