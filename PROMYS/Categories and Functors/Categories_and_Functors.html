  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1. </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Ideas behind Category Theory</h3>
<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >In the mid 20<sup class="textsuperscript"><span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">th</span></sup> century, a lot of math was happening, &#xFB01;elds like algebraic topology and
homological algebra were developing, and people realized that there were ways of talking and
thinking about math that simpli&#xFB01;ed what they were doing. Then in 1945, Mac Lane and Eilenberg
launched category theory by de&#xFB01;ning a category, functor, and natural transformation. Since then
category theory and categorical thinking has been prevalent in all sorts of mathematics. It is
a very &#x201C;clean&#x201D; sort of mathematics: you take a problem into a more general, easier
to work with, context, and use properties of this general context to deduce what you
want. Rarely are there many ugly technical lemmas, rather the power comes from the
de&#xFB01;nitions.
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >  Note: I do not expect everyone to understand every example I give in this lecture series. Because
category theory is so widespread, it is possible to give examples in many di&#xFB00;erent &#xFB01;elds, and to
expect my audience to have the background to understand each of these examples is
asking a lot. Instead, many examples will likely be algebraic or topological in nature,
and I hope that my audience will attempt to understand all of my examples even if
succeeding proves to be impossible for some of them. Indeed I believe that the more
examples of a categorical idea you have thought carefully about, the better you understand
it.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >  Here are two examples of solving a problem that are categorical in their approach. The &#xFB01;rst,
known as Bu&#xFB00;on&#x2019;s Needle, is the following: suppose we drop a needle of length 1 onto a
collection of lines spaces 1 apart from one another. What is the probability of the needle
intersecting one of the lines? To answer this, we &#xFB01;rst observe that the probability of the
needle hitting a line is the same as the expectation, since the needle cannot hit two
lines.
</p><!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >  We can ask, what is the expected number of lines a noodle hits, where a noodle is like a needle
except it doesn&#x2019;t have to be straight or length one. Since expectation is linear, the answer will be
proportional to the length of the noodle. Here we have done something categorical: changing to the
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
more convenient context of noodles and expectation, which gives us more &#xFB02;exibility in approaching
the problem.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >  If we choose our noodle to be the circle of diameter 1, the expected number of lines hit is 2.
Then by linearity the expectation our original line has expectation \(\frac{2}{\pi }\), and so this is also its
probability. Picking out the circle as a particularly nice object is another categorical element in the
proof.
</p><!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >  The second is as follows: Let \(T\) be the set of &#x0028;possibly empty&#x0029; binary rooted trees. \(T\) is in
bijection with \(T^2 + 1\): pairs of binary rooted trees with an extra element as follows: a tree
in \(T\) is either empty &#x0028;corresponding to 1&#x0029; or has a root, which splits into two &#x0028;possibly
empty&#x0029; binary rooted trees &#x0028;corresponding to \(T^2\)&#x0029;. Working in the semi-ring \(\NN [T]/(T=T^2+1)\) we can prove
that \(T = T^7\), giving us an explicit bijection between \(T\) and \(T^7\). That this can be done is hinted to
by the fact that \(T = T^2+1 \implies T = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{6}} \implies T^7 = T\). This proof is a kind of categori&#xFB01;cation, taking some mathematical
context and describing it in a general &#x0028;and abstract&#x0029; context to reveal insights about
it.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >  So what is category theory? One description is the study of structure. Wherever there
is structure, it is possible that a categorical viewpoint may be helpful. However, it is
also a way of thinking as described in the two earlier paragraphs. Because category
theory likes to look at mathematical objects at its bare bones, it is often quite abstract.
Hence I think that in order to truly understand and appreciate it, it is necessary to
have plenty of examples to work with, which I intend to provide during this lecture
series.

 id="x1-20002"></a>What is a category?</h3>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >When we do mathematics, we tend not to study objects in isolation. For example, we don&#x2019;t just
study sets, but also the functions between them. We don&#x2019;t just study groups, but also the
homomorphisms between them. We don&#x2019;t study just topological spaces, but the continuous
functions between them. Hence the notion of a category:

<span 
class="cmti-12">has an arrow from it to itself called</span> \(1_a\)<span 
class="cmti-12">, which is an identity with composition.</span>
</p>
  </div>
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >  We can denote the set of arrows in \(C\) from \(a\) to \(b\) in \(C(a,b)\) &#x0028;some use \(\Hom (a,b)\)&#x0029;, and write \(\dom{f}=a\) and \(\cod{f}=b\) &#x0028;domain and
codomain&#x0029;. As shorthand, we say \(a,b \in C\) and \(f:a\to b\) is an arrow. What are examples of categories? Familiar
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
ones are the category of sets, groups, topological spaces, rings, totally ordered sets, varieties,
abelian groups, R-modules&#x0028;&#xFB01;gure out what the arrows are&#x0029;. In category theory, it is emphasized
that the arrows are more important than the objects: For example, we don&#x2019;t care what a
particular group is, rather just its isomorphism class and how it relates to other groups.
However, these examples might make it seem that arrows should be thought of as a kind
of function, which is not always the best viewpoint. For example, a partial order is
just a category in which there is at most one arrow between any two objects &#x0028;an arrow
from \(a\) to \(b\) can be interpreted as \(a \leq b\). Finally, consider a category with just one object such
that every arrow has a right and left inverse with respect to composition. This is just a
group.
</p><!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >  Here are some notions that you are probably familiar with that can be described
categorically.

</p>
  </div>
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >  This matches the de&#xFB01;nition of isomorphism that you are used to in familiar categories. For
example, in the category of sets, \(\Set \), this is just a bijection. In the category of groups, \(\Grp \), and rings \(\Ring \) or \(\CRing \)
&#x0028;C for commutative&#x0029;, it is an isomorphism, and in the category of topological spaces, \(\Top \), it is just a
homeomorphism.
</p><!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >  Suppose \(f\) is an arrow. Then \(g\) is a <span 
class="cmbx-12">section </span>of \(f\) if it is a right inverse, ie \(f \circ g = 1_{\cod{f}}\). This word also is familiar
in our various contexts. For example in \(\Set \), this is essentially a choice function. In \(\Top \), which is probably
where the word originates from, this is just an embedding of a space inside something that can
collapse to it. For example, If you consider a closed manifold, you can consider its orientation
double cover. The manifold is orientable if and only if there is a section of this cover.

another space that covers it. In the picture above, from The M&#x00F6;bius band we construct an
untwisted band with a map from the band to the M&#x00F6;bius band, and from \(S^2\) we construct

with continuous maps to the original. Our original space is orientable &#x0028;eg. the M&#x00F6;bius band

<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >  Note that when \(C\) and \(D\) are groups, this is just a group homomorphism. What are examples of
functors? Algebraic topology in a sense is all about studying functors. For example consider the
category \(\Top ^*\), which is just pairs \((X,x_0)\) of topological spaces with a base point. Morphisms here are just
continuous maps that take base points to base points. Now we can consider, up to a continuous
deformation, oriented paths on \(X\) that start and end at \(x_0\). We can add these paths by concatenation
and this gives us a group, called the fundamental group, written \(\pi _1(X,x_0)\). This is a functor, as given a
morphism \(f\) from \((X,x_0)\) to \((Y,y_0)\) we get a homomorphism on their fundamental group \(\pi _1(f)\) from \(\pi _1(X,x_0)\) to \(\pi _1(Y,y_0)\) by
sending a path on \(X\) through \(f\). We can easily check that this satis&#xFB01;es the properties of a
functor.
</p><!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >  So why do algebraic topologists care about functors? Well they allow one to study topological
spaces more easily. For example, one might wonder if the torus, \(S^1\times S^1\) and the sphere, \(S^2\), are
homeomorphic spaces. One might have a hard time showing directly that these two spaces are
homeomorphic, but one can easily see this from the fact that \(\pi _1\) is a functor. For if \(f\) and \(g\) are
inverse maps that are homeomorphisms between \(S^1\times S^1\) to \(S^2\), \(\pi _1\) is compatible with composition, so
\(\pi _1f\) and \(\pi _2f\) will be isomorphisms between the fundamental groups of the two spaces. But
one can actually compute the fundamental groups of these spaces, which are \(\ZZ ^2\) and the
trivial group \(\{1\}\) respectively, which are di&#xFB00;erent groups. Thus the two spaces cannot be
homeomorphic.

category.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >  Here is another slightly less trivial topological example. Consider the disk \(D^2\). One may ask, does
every map from the disk to itself have a &#xFB01;xed point? This can be proven using \(\pi _1\), and its
n-dimensional analog can be proven similarly using another functor, called cohomology. We do the
following: suppose that a map \(f\) existed from \(D^2\) to \(D^2\) that didn&#x2019;t have a &#xFB01;xed point. Then we could
draw the line between \(x\) to \(f(x)\) and on the side of the line where x is, we would get a point on the
boundary, \(S^1\). Doing this for all \(x \in D^2\) would give a continuous map \(g\) from \(D^2\) to \(S^1\), that restricted to \(S^1\) is the

</p><!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >  The notion of a commutative diagram is an important one, and is worth discussing a bit
more before moving on. Even though in this particular example, it might have been
easier to write the equation down instead of drawing a diagram, as one studies more
complicated things, diagrams &#x0028;and commutative ones&#x0029; become concise presentations
of what could have been a lot of symbols. Part of the mindset of category theory is
to be able to describe what is going on in terms of a diagram. In fact, in a sense, a
diagram is really itself just a functor. For example, I will tell you what functor the
diagram above is. I will de&#xFB01;ne a category I call the split idempotent category, or \(\SIdem \), with
two objects, \(A\) and \(B\), and three non identity arrows \(k\) and \(l\). It looks like the following:

\(l\) to \(f\), and on objects &#x0028;though this is redundant&#x0029; it sends \(A\) to \(\ZZ \) and \(B\) to \(\{1\}\). The fact that the triangle
commutes is encoded in the fact that \(k \circ l = 1_A\). One may similarly view all diagrams as a functor from an
appropriate category.

<!--l. 109--><p class="indent" >  Here is how this can prove, for example, Cantor&#x2019;s Theorem. Suppose that \(X\) were in bijection with
\(W^X\). We have an evaluation map \(e(-,-)\) from \(X\times W^X\) to \(W\) that takes \(x \in X\) and \(f \in W^X\) &#x0028;viewed as a function \(W \to X\)&#x0029; and evaluates it on
\(x\). But now that \(X\) and \(W^X\) are in bijection, this can be seen as just a map from \(X\times X\) to \(W\). The evaluation map
has a very special property: any map from \(X\) to \(W\) is of the form \(e(-,x)\) for some \(x \in X \cong W^X\). In the diagram above, let \(\phi \)
be any map from \(W\) to itself, and let \(\Delta \) be the diagonal map, taking \(x\) to \((x,x)\). We know that the
composite \(\phi \circ e(-,-)\circ \Delta \) is of the form \(e(-,x)\). What happens if we chase x around the diagram? Let&#x2019;s try it.

element.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >  If one is not familiar with this style of proof, it may seem strange. &#x201C;Why would anyone want to
give this strange argument when I can just prove this normally?&#x201D; Well it turns out viewing the
diagonalization argument in this light makes the argument generalizable to other contexts &#x0028;a
common theme in category theory&#x0029;. For example, we can show that the impossibility of solving the
halting problem using the same diagram. Now, we with to interpret \(X\) as the set of natural numbers, \(W\)
as the set \(\{T,F\}\) and \(\phi \) as the function swapping \(T\) and \(F\). \(e\) will now be a program that supposedly can
solve the halting problem: it takes in a natural number \(x\), and a &#x0028;code for a&#x0029; program \(y\),
and halts if and only if \(y\) halts on \(x\). It takes values in \(W\) as \(T\) if it halts and \(F\) if it doesn&#x2019;t.
Now this e has the analogous property to \(W^X\): if \(x \in X\) is a program that takes values in \(W\), it is
of the form \(e(-,x)\). Then by the exact same argument, \(\phi \) must have a &#xFB01;xed point, which is
impossible.
</p><!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >  In this way, the categorical proof of the diagonalization argument really gets to why the
argument works, as it easily applies to analogous situations.
</p><!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >  Let&#x2019;s get back to examples of functors. From each of the categories \(\CRing \),\(\Grp \), and \(\Top \) is a <span 
class="cmbx-12">forgetful</span>
<span 
class="cmbx-12">functor </span>to \(\Set \): it takes a group for example, to its underlying set, and a homomorphism to its
underlying function. These are not interesting in of themselves, but are interesting in relation to
other functors. A category equipped with a forgetful functor to \(\Set \) is called a <span 
class="cmbx-12">concrete category</span>.
                                                                                         
                                                                                         
For example, perhaps you are familiar with the discrete/indiscrete topologies, or the free group.
These are functors from \(\Set \) to \(\Top \) and \(\Grp \) which are intimately related with these forgetful functors, but I
won&#x2019;t be talking about that this time.
</p><!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >  My last example for now of a functor is the covariant Hom functor. If \(C\) is a category, and \(a\) is an
object in it, we can consider the functor \(C(a,-)\) which takes \(b \in C\) &#x0028;I will now just say \(C\) instead of \(O_C\)&#x0029; to \(C(a,b)\). on
arrows, it takes \(f:b \to c\) to the function from \(C(a,b)\) to \(C(a,c)\) that takes an arrow from \(a\) to \(b\) and composes it with \(f\).
What if we tried to de&#xFB01;ne a functor \(C(-,a)\) similarly? Well we can do it, except notice something
interesting happens. Now, a map \(b \to c\) induces a map \(C(c,a) \to C(b,a)\): the direction of arrow has switched! Then this
cannot be a functor, right? Well it is, if you are careful about which two categories it is a
functor between &#x0028;this will be discussed in more detail later&#x0029;. A functor that switches
the direction of arrows is called a <span 
class="cmbx-12">contravariant functor</span>. A functor that does not
switch the direction of arrows is <span 
class="cmbx-12">covariant</span>. Then the functor \(C(-,a)\) is contravariant while \(C(a,-)\) is
covariant.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >  Given two functors, one may compose them in the obvious way. Indeed, one still gets a functor,
and this composition is obviously associative. Additionally, every category \(C\) has an identity functor \(1_C\)
which is de&#xFB01;ned the obvious way. In this way we can make the category \(\Cat \) which consists of
categories and the functors between them.
</p><!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >  One note is that we sometimes care about the sizes of the sets we are working with. For
example, there are a *lot* of objects and arrows in \(\Set \), large enough that we need to describe \(\Set \) in a
larger universe of sets. Because of this, we call \(\Set \) a <span 
class="cmbx-12">large category</span>. Any category that can be
described in \(\Set \) &#x0028;ie the sets of objects and arrows are in \(\Set \)&#x0029; is called a <span 
class="cmbx-12">small category</span>. Any category \(C\)
for which \(C(a,b)\) can be described in \(\Set \) are called <span 
class="cmbx-12">locally small categories</span>. We shouldn&#x2019;t worry about
these distinctions too much right now.
