<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >The cobordism hypothesis gives a classi&#xFB01;cation of extended topological &#xFB01;eld theories on
manifolds with certain structures.
</p><!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >  Fix a space \(X\) with a rank \(n\) vector bundle \(\xi \). Let \(\Bord _n^{X,\xi }\) denote the symmetric monoidal \((\infty ,n)\) category,
where \(i\)-morphisms for \(i\leq n\) are manifolds \(M^i\) with corners with an \((X,\xi )\) structure. This means we
think of the manifold as a bordism between manifolds between \(i-1\)-dimensional manifolds,
and the \((X,\xi )\) structure is a map \(M^i \to X\) and an identi&#xFB01;cation of \(\RR ^{n-i}\) plus the tangent bundle of \(M\) with \(\xi \). For
\(i&gt;n\), the morphisms are di&#xFB00;eomorphisms, isotopies between di&#xFB00;eomorphisms, etc.
We can think of \(X\) as the classifying space \(BG\) of a &#x0028;topological&#x0029; groupoid, so that
lifting a morphism from \(BO(n)\) to \(BG=X\) can be thought of as giving a \(G\) structure on a rank \(n\)
bundle.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >  Let \(\tilde{X}\) be the frame bundle on \(X\) coming from the map to \(BO(n)\). The cobordism hypothesis
is:

when \(X\) is a point.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >  A special case of this result is the result due to Galatius-Madsen-Tillmann-Weiss which
describes invertible &#xFB01;eld theories. Just as before we have a map \(BG \to BO(n)\), and we consider the

<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >  Note that we can take \(n \to \infty \) to get \(\Bord _{\infty }^{X,\xi }\), an \((\infty ,\infty )\) category of bordisms. This is a category that is
stable in two ways: We have already stabilized with respect to dimension, meaning that we
only care about the stable tangent bundles of manifolds. We have also stabilized with
respect to embedding dimension, we can think of the manifolds involved as embedded in \(\RR ^\infty \).
This is re&#xFB02;ected on the categorical side by having the category be symmetric
monoidal.
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >  Note that given a compatible family of maps to \(BO(n)\), we can let \(n\) go to \(\infty \), to describe the
geometric realization of the \(\infty ,\infty \)-bordism category as a Thom spectrum where the group has
been stabilized eg \(MTO\), \(MTU\). This looks similar to the result of Pontryagin-Thom, but is
subtly di&#xFB00;erent: the de&#xFB01;nition of bordism category for &#xFB01;eld theories involves
manifolds with structures on their stable tangent bundles, but the de&#xFB01;nition of
standard cobordism spectra like \(MO\) and \(MU\) involves manifolds with structures on
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
their stable normal bundles. In many cases these two coincide: \(MO = MTO, MSO= MTSO, MU = MTU, MSpin = MTSpin\), but not always:
\(MPin_+=MTPin_-\).
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >  There is also a way to destabilize the cobordism hypthesis with respect to
embedding dimension. This yields the tangle hypothesis, which is essentially the same
as the cobordism hypothesis, except all manifolds involved are embedded, and
the categories aren&#x2019;t symmetric monoidal, but rather \(k\)-fold monoidal &#x0028;ie have \(k\)
deloopings&#x0029;.
</p>
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2. </span> <a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>Outline</h3>
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >Here is an outline of the steps of the proof:
</p>
          <ul class="itemize1">
       <li class="itemize">First we reformulate the cobordism hypothesis in an inductive way. Let \(X,\xi \) be a
       space with a principle \(O(n)\)-bundle \(\xi \) as in the construction of the bordism category.
       Let \(X_0\) be the sphere bundle of associated to the bundle, with a map \(f\) to \(X\). \(f^*\xi \) splits
       canonically as \(\RR \oplus \xi _0\), where \(\xi _0\) is the bundle of vectors orthogonal to the vector on the
       sphere. Adding the trivial copy of \(\RR \) gives an inclusion \(\Bord _{n-1}^{X_0,\xi _0} \to \Bord _{n}^{X,\xi }\). We will reformulate the
       universal property of \(\Bord _{n}^{X,\xi }\) in terms of how to extend functors along this inclusion.
       The universal property will say that we need to specify what the &#xFB01;eld theory
       does on a disk of dimension \(n\) with a nondegeneracy condition on the morphism
       corresponding to the disk.
          </li>
       <li class="itemize">The next step is only for simplicity &#x0028;rather than necessity&#x0029;: we will reduce
       to proving the cobordism hypothesis for the unoriented bordism category \(\Bord _n\). It
       isn&#x2019;t too surprising that we can do this, since the unoriented bordism category
       is universal in the sense that its choice of \(X,\xi \) is universal, however the actual
       implementation is a bit more subtle.
          </li>
       <li class="itemize">Since the inclusions \(\Bord _n \to \Bord _{n+1}\) are highly connected &#x0028;their \(k\) morphisms agree for small
       \(k\)&#x0029; and lots of duals exist, it is possible to capture the data of the inclusions
       in terms of \((\infty ,1)\)-categorical data, which is nice because \((\infty ,1)\)-categories are easier to
       work with.
          </li>
       <li class="itemize">The most important step in the proof will use a version of Morse theory
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
       due to Igusa to prove the cobordism hypothesis for another category \(\Bord _n^{ff}\). In
       particular, we can understand bordisms in terms of handle attachments and
       cancellations, which will give generators and relations for \(\Bord _n^{ff}\) in terms of \(\Bord _{n-1}\). The
       di&#xFB00;erence between \(\Bord _n^{ff}\) and \(\Bord _n\) is nonexistent, and is can be thought of as the
       irrelevence of the choice of Morse function.
          </li>
       <li class="itemize">The last step of the proof is one that really shouldn&#x2019;t have to be there,
       namely proving that \(\Bord _n^{ff}\) is equivalent to \(\Bord _n\). Doing this involves understanding
       an  obstruction  theory  for  \((\infty ,n)\)-categories,  knowing  from  some  Morse  theory
       that they are equivalent in a range of dimensions, and doing cohomological
       computations to show that the two agree in general. The reason this step
       shouldn&#x2019;t have to be there is that it is equivalent to a conjecture about to
       Igusa&#x2019;s Morse theory. If an independent proof of that conjecture existed, this
       step could be avoided. Nevertheless, this step is interesting, as one has to try
       to do stable homotopy theory with \((\infty ,n)\)-categories.</li></ul>
  <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3. </span> <a 
 id="x1-40003"></a>Inductive formulation</h3>
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >Recall that there is an map \(\Bord _{n-1}^{X_0,\xi _0} \to \Bord _n^{X,\xi }\), where \(X_0\) is the unit sphere bundle of \(\xi \). Let \(C\) be as in the
cobordism hypothesis, and consider a &#xFB01;eld theory on \(\Bord _{n-1}^{X_0,\xi _0}\) we would like to extend along \(\Bord _n^{X,\xi }\). For
each \(x \in X\), the unit disk of \(\xi \) at \(x\), \(D^n_x\) is a bordism from \(\phi \) to \(S^{n-1}_x\), the &#xFB01;bre of \(X_0 \to X\) at \(x\). The sphere \(S^{n-1}_x\) can be
broken into two hemispheres, making it the composite \(D_+\circ D_-\). We say that \(D^n_x: \phi \to D_+\circ D_-\) exhibits \(D_+\) as right
adjoint to \(D_-\). This is a condition that doesn&#x2019;t depend on the way we broke up \(S^{n-1}_x\) into
hemispheres.

the same in each category. Thus there aren&#x2019;t as many levels of noninvertible morphisms

boundary.
</p><!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >  Let&#x2019;s see how this replacement works for \(n=1\). \(\Bord _1=\Cob _{\partial }^{un}(1)\). The map \(\Bord _1 \to \Bord _2\) is essentially surjective, and for
any \(X,Y\) in \(\Bord _2\), the category \(Maps_{\Bord _2}(X,Y)\) is equivalent to \(Maps_{\Bord _2}(1,Y\otimes X^{\vee })\). This means that to recover the map
to \(\Bord _2\) we just need to remember \(Y \mapsto Maps_{\Bord _2}(1,Y)\) as a lax monoidal functor \(\Bord _1 \to \Cat _{(\infty ,1)}\). But by a version of
the Grothendieck construction, this is equivalent to a coCartesion &#xFB01;bration to \(\Bord _1\),
and one can show this gives exactly something equivalent to \(\Cob _{\partial }^{un}(2)\). This example can

<!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" >\(\Omega ^{n-2}\Bord _{n-1}\) is the category \(\Cob _{t}^{un}(n-1)\) of closed unoriented manifolds of dimension \(n-2\) and bordisms between
them. The map \(\Bord _{n-1} \to \Bord _n\) corresponds via the above proposition to the map \(\Cob _{t}^{un}(n-1)\) sending an \(n-2\)
manifold \(M\) to the category \(B(M)\), where the objects are \(n-1\)-manifolds equipped with a
di&#xFB00;eomorphism of their boundary with \(M\), and the maps are bordisms that are trivial on the
boundary between such manifolds. To analyse this category, we will use Morse
theory.
</p><!--l. 116--><p class="indent" >  Let&#x2019;s recall the basic idea of Morse theory: Suppose you have a compact manifold \(N\) and
you choose a smooth Morse &#x0028;i.e generic&#x0029; function \(f\) from \(N\) to the real numbers \(\RR \). Morse
means that its derivative vanishes at isolated points such that the Hessian is
nondegenerate. We can consider the process of building up \(N\) from its descending manifolds \(N^d_{r}\)
which is the preimage under \(f\) of \((-\infty ,r]\). The di&#xFB00;eomorphism type of \(N^d_{r}\) is empty for small \(r\) and \(N\) for
large \(r\), and only changes when a critical point of \(f\) happens &#x0028;because apart from that \(f\) is
a proper submersion&#x0029;. By the nondegeneracy hypothesis, the di&#xFB00;eomorphism
type changes at the critical points in a very predictable way, namely by handle
attachments.
</p><!--l. 118--><p class="indent" >  A \(d\)-handle \(H\) in dimension \(n\) is a copy of \(D^{n-d}\times D^d\) with an attaching map \(\phi : D^{n-d}\times S^{d-1} \to N\) onto a manifold with
boundary \(N\). We can glue the handle \(H\cup _\phi N\) along \(\phi \) and smooth the corners to obtain another
smooth manifold with boundary, a process we refer to as attaching a handle. Every
time we pass a critical point, our manifold changes by a handle attachment, and
moreover the attaching data is determined by local data of the critical point.
For example \(d\) is the index of the Hessian as a symmstric bilinear form over the
reals.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >  The perspective we want to take is that choosing a Morse function really is a way of
presenting \(N\) as a bordism. For example, by choosing a Morse function with critical points
who take on distinct values we obtain the result that every bordism is a composite of
handle attachments, as we can break up \(N\) into \(f^{-1}([a_i,a_{i+1}])\), where only one critical point occurs within
each interval. When we attach a \(d\)-handle, we do surgery on the boundary of the manifold,
replacing a copy of \(D^{n-d}\times S^{d-1}\) with \(S^{n-d-1}\times D^{d}\).
</p><!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >  A more re&#xFB01;ned version of Morse theory, called Cerf theory, explains how to
move between di&#xFB00;erent Morse functions \(f_0,f_1\) via a family \(f_t\) that fail to be Morse at
&#xFB01;nitely many values in predictable ways. One can describe all the possible moves
entirely at the level of handles. the two possible moves are essentially changing the
time when a handle is attached, isotoping the attaching map \(\phi \) of a handle, and
cancelling or uncancelling a pair of \(d\) and \(d-1\) handles whose cores intersect geometrically
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
once.
</p><!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >  However what we really want is even more sophisticated than Cerf theory: we want an
understanding of the whole space of ways to present a bordism, not just generic paths
between bordisms. To do this we use Igusa&#x2019;s theory of framed functions. A framed function
is like a Morse function with slightly worse singularities allowed &#x0028;those that occur
when cancelling handles&#x0029;, and a identi&#xFB01;cation of the negative index part of the
Hessian at each critical point with a standard negative de&#xFB01;nite form. We can
replace \(B(M)\) with \(B(M)^{ff}\) where the \(1\)-morphisms in \(B(M)^{ff}\) are equipped with framed functions.
There is a natural map \(B(M)^{ff}\) to \(B(M)\) that forgets the structure. By the category unfolding
equivalence, the assignment \(M \mapsto B(M)\) corresponds to a map \(\Bord _{n-1} \to \Bord _{n}^ff\), and moreover we get a map
\(\Bord _{n}^ff \to \Bord _n\).
</p><!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >  The point is to use Igusa&#x2019;s theory to prove that the cobordism hypothesis holds for the
map \(\Bord _{n-1} to \Bord _n^{ff}\), and then show that \(\Bord _n^{ff}\) and \(\Bord _n\) agree.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="indent" >  \(\Bord _n^{ff}\) is good because it is as if each morphism comes with a presentation in terms of handle
attachments. To study it, we will &#xFB01;lter between \(\Bord _n\) and \(\Bord _n^{ff}\) via a category \(F_k\), which will unfold to
the assignment \(M \mapsto B_k(M)\) where \(B_k(M)\) is the category of bordisms for which all ciritcal points are index \(\leq k\).
For \(k\geq n\) this is just \(B^{ff}(M)\) and for \(k &lt; 0\), there are no critical points so all the bordisms are trivial. Thus
the \(F_k\) interpolate between \(\Bord _{n-1}\) and \(\Bord _n^{ff}\), and are called the index &#xFB01;ltration. It will turn out that
only index \(0\) and index \(1\) are important with respect to mapping into fully dualizable
categories.
</p><!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >  Given this &#xFB01;ltration, the main things proven about it are essentially a version of handle
calculus:
</p>
          <ul class="itemize1">
       <li class="itemize">The functor \(B_0: \Omega ^{n-2}\Bord _{n-1} \to \Cat _{(\infty ,1)}\) is freely generated as a lax symmetric monoidal functor by
       the  \(O(n)\)-equivariant  morphism  given  by  a  disk  in  \(B_k(\phi )\).  Note  that  there  is  no
       nondegeneracy condition as well as no dualizability condition on the target.
       This is quite reasonable to expect, since for index \(0\), we can only add in disks
       that are disjoint to the rest of the bordism, and this is a well de&#xFB01;ned operation
       up to a \(O(n)\) action. This implies that \(F_0\) is freely generated as a symmetric monoidal
       \((\infty ,n)\)-category from \(\Bord _n\) by a morphism given by a disk.

       <li class="itemize">For \(k&gt;0\), the functor \(B_k: \Omega ^{n-2}\Bord _{n-1} \to \Cat _{(\infty ,1)}\) is generated from \(B_{k-1}\) by an \(O(n-k)\)-equivariant \(1\)-morphism &#x0028;handle

       nondegenerate. This quite reasonably follows from the previous, since the only
       relation obtained when adding a \(1\)-handle is cancellation with \(0\)-handles, and
       we can copy the proof of the \((1,1)\)-categorical cobordism hypothesis in dimension
       \(1\) using \(0\) and \(1\)-handles to see that this just adds in the relation that the disk is

       and involves thinking more carefully about how the unfolding of categories
       works. The point is that the handle cancellations of \(k-1\) and \(k\)-handles impose
       another nondegeneracy condition, that is redundant when mapping to \(C\), since
       duals are essentially unique. Alternatively, the rest of the handles can be
       thought of as being there to make the category \(\Bord _n\) itself have duals.</li></ul>

that it is an equivalence on the fundamental groupoid, which is a connectivity
statement.
</p><!--l. 145--><p class="indent" >  Here, we will use a generalization of the Postnikov tower, namely the \((m,n)\)-truncation of an
\((\infty ,n)\)-category &#x0028;or the homotopy \(m\)-category&#x0029;. The analog of Eilenberg-Maclane spaces and
cohomology will arise from the category \(\Loc (C)\) of local systems on \(C\), which for an \((\infty ,n)\) category has
an inductive de&#xFB01;nition. For example \(n=0\) it is just a functor into abelian groups, and for \(n=1\) we
                                                                                  

                                                                                  
require a functor from \(Maps(x,y)\) into abelian groups as well as a map local systems on \(Maps(x,y)\times Maps(y,z)\) from the
product of the pullbacks of the local system on \(Maps(x,y)\) and \(Maps(y,z)\) to the pullback of the local system on
\(Maps(x,z)\).
</p><!--l. 147--><p class="indent" >  The de&#xFB01;nition of cohomology on a local system is also inductive, and can be thought
of as the homotopy classes of sections of a &#xFB01;bration of \((\infty ,n)\)-categories whose &#xFB01;bres
are Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. There are a few subtleties, for example that we
really would like to work with a local system compatible with the symmetric
monoidal structure &#x0028;since we are essentially doing stable homotopy theory for
\(n\)-categories&#x0029;.
</p><!--l. 149--><p class="indent" >  The resulting obstruction theory says that a map \(C \to C'\) of symmetric monoidal \((\infty ,n)\)-categories is
an equivalence i&#xFB00; it is an equivalence on homotopy \((n+1,n)\)-categories and induces an
isomorphism on cohomology in any local system. In the case of interest, the &#xFB01;rst claim
comes from a reult of Igusa on connectivity of the space of framed functions
on a bordism. The cobordism hypothesis can be used to identify the relative
cohomology of the pair \((\Bord _n,\Bord _{n-1})\) with a degree shifted cohomology of \(BO(n)\) for appropriate coe&#xFB03;cient
systems. This result is then true for \(\Bord _n^{ff}\), so it su&#xFB03;ces to show it is also true for
\(\Bord _n\).
</p><!--l. 151--><p class="indent" >  This relative cohomology for constant local systems is also the relative cohomology of
the pair \((\Sigma ^{n} MTO(n),\Sigma ^{n-1}MTO(n-1))\). But the co&#xFB01;bre of these spectra is indeed \(\Sigma ^{\infty +n}_+ BO(n)\), by cohomology calculations in the
work of GMTW. The paper claims that their methods can be generalized to show that the
relative cohomology agrees for arbitrary coe&#xFB03;cient systems, which completes the
proof.
